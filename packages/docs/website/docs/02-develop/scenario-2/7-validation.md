title: Verify Scenario

:::tip VALIDATION GUIDANCE

Here are examples of expected outcomes and how to validate them:

- For an API response, check the status code and the response content.

- For a web site image, verify that the image is displayed correctly on the web page.

- For a set of test files generated as part of playwright, ensure that the files are created and contain the expected content.

This scenario must have steps so that a customer can know they have completed it successfully, so an end state that can be validated.

_Examples:_

- an API response
- a web site image
- a set of test files generated as part of playwright
